# card-games

This project is a card game app where users can log in and play card games such as Blackjack, by themselves or with others, and track their overall stats on a database. This was created as a final project for UCLA's CS35L class.

# Building and running the app locally

```
git clone https://github.com/NeekTheGiraffe/card-games.git
cd card-games
npm install
npm start
```
This will create a copy of the repository on your machine, install the required Node dependencies, and run a development version of the app on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
